#I don't know if this is necessary to include but this is how I created the files.




#Created the '.env' file from this cell using this code: 

#with open(".env", "w") as f:
#f.write("CENSUS_API_KEY=my_key\n")
#Installing the necessary packages for ACS retrival
!pip install requests pandas python-dotenv

#check

import requests, pandas, dotenv, os
print("All packages imported successfully")


#create the necessary folders and files

for folder in ["data", "results", "src"]:
    os.makedirs(folder, exist_ok=True)

print("Folders created successfully.")

#creating a 'gitignore' file so Git will ignore

with open(".gitignore", "w") as f:
    f.write(".env\n")
    f.write("data/\n")
    f.write("results/\n")


#verifying the existence of the .env and .gitignore files
!ls -a
